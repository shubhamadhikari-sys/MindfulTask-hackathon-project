MindfulTask Pro is a smart productivity web app that blends task management with mental wellness. Powered by Google Gemini AI, it tracks a user’s Vitality Score (Mood, Energy, Focus) and offers compassionate, context-aware guidance—encouraging breaks when energy is low and deep work when focus is high.
